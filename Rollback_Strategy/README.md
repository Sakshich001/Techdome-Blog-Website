## Rollback Strategy for Infrastructure Changes

**Rolling back infrastructure changes is crucial to maintain application availability and stability.**

Hereâ€™s a structured approach to rollback strategy:

**1.Monitoring and Alerts:**
   Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect issues promptly. Monitor metrics such as application health, performance, and resource usage.
   
**2.Automated Rollback Policy:**
Define automated rollback policies triggered by predefined conditions (e.g., increased error rates, service unavailability).
Kubernetes provides features like readiness and liveness probes which can automatically trigger rollback if the application fails health checks during deployment.

**3.Rollback Steps**:
If an issue is detected post-deployment:
- Identify the Issue: Use monitoring tools and logs to identify the root cause of the problem.
   - Rollback Execution: Use kubectl rollout undo command to revert to the previous known good version of deployments.
   - Verification: Verify that the rollback was successful and the application stability is restored.
  
**4.Testing Rollback Procedures:**
Regularly simulate rollback scenarios in a staging environment to ensure that rollback procedures are well-documented, understood, and effective.

**5.Post-Rollback Analysis:**
Conduct a post-mortem analysis to understand the cause of the issue and implement preventive measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.
